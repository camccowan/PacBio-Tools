# PacBio-Tools

I am in the process of creating a collection of tools to automate PacBio data analysis in FireCloud.  Currently, it is difficult to automate multi-step pipelines using the CLI (command line interface) tools.

As a corrolary to this project, I have generated a docker image that contains the PacBio CLI tools in a compatible lunix environemt.  The Dockerfile is available in this repository.
